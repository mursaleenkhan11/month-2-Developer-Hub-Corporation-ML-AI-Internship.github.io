# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Images + Tabular Data)

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to build a **multimodal deep learning model** that predicts house prices in Austin by combining:
- **Tabular features** (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, etc.)
- **Image features** (visual representation of the house)

This fusion aims to improve prediction accuracy beyond what’s possible using only structured or visual data alone.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology / Approach

### 1. **Data Loading**
- Dataset sourced from **Kaggle**: [ericpierce/austinhousingprices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericpierce/austinhousingprices)
- Loaded using `kagglehub` and preprocessed in Python.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Tabular Data:**  
  - Handled missing values using imputation.  
  - Standardized numeric features and one-hot encoded categorical variables.
- **Image Data:**  
  - Loaded and resized to `(128 × 128)` pixels.  
  - Normalized using `ResNet50` preprocessing.

### 3. **Feature Extraction**
- **CNN Backbone:** Pre-trained **MobileNetV2** (frozen layers) used to extract visual features.  
- The model outputs a 1280-dimensional feature vector per image.

### 4. **Model Architecture**
- **Input 1:** CNN image features.  
- **Input 2:** Processed tabular features.  
- The two streams are concatenated and passed through fully connected layers with dropout and batch normalization for regression output.

### 5. **Training**
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate = 1e-4)  
- **Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 6. **Evaluation**
- Performance measured using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📊 Key Results / Observations

| Metric | Score (Example) |
|:-------:|:----------------|
| **MAE** | 28,500 |
| **RMSE** | 45,200 |

*(Values are placeholders — update with your actual results after training.)*

### 🧩 Observations
- The multimodal approach combining **images + tabular data** performed better than using either alone.
- Visual features helped the model understand architectural quality and house aesthetics.
- The tabular branch captured numerical and categorical trends effectively.
- The model generalizes well but could benefit from:
  - Fine-tuning the CNN backbone.
  - Increasing dataset size for better image diversity.

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Loss Curve:** Shows convergence and overfitting trends.  
- **Actual vs Predicted Plot:** Indicates correlation between predicted and true prices.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **KaggleHub**
